EXAMPLE: Social Media App Features

This is an example raw idea file. Replace this with your own brainstorming!

====================================
WHAT I WANT TO BUILD
====================================

I want to build a simple social media app where users can share their thoughts and interact with each other.

USER FEATURES:

Registration & Authentication:
- Users should register with email and password
- Send verification email after registration
- They can only login if email is verified
- Password must be at least 8 characters

Posts:
- Users can create posts with text and images
- Posts can be up to 500 characters
- Users can attach one image per post
- Users can edit their own posts within 24 hours
- Users can delete their own posts anytime
- When viewing posts, show author name, post time, and content

Social Interactions:
- Users can like posts (unlimited)
- Users can unlike posts
- Show like count on each post
- Users can comment on posts
- Comments are text only, max 200 characters
- Users can delete their own comments
- Show all comments under each post

Feed:
- Users see a feed of all posts (newest first)
- Add pagination - 20 posts per page
- Filter posts by specific user

VALIDATION RULES:

Email:
- Must be valid email format
- Must be unique - can't register twice with same email

Password:
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain at least one uppercase, one lowercase, and one number

- Maximum 500 characters
- Image is optional
- Supported image formats: JPG, PNG, GIF
- Maximum image size: 5MB

Comments:
- Text is required
- Maximum 200 characters

BUSINESS RULES:

- Users can only edit/delete their own posts
- Users can only delete their own comments
- Anyone can like/comment on anyone's posts
- Deleted posts should remove all likes and comments
- Email verification link expires after 24 hours

NOTIFICATIONS (maybe later?):
- Email when someone likes your post
- Email when someone comments on your post

====================================
TECHNICAL NOTES
====================================

Not sure about these, but thinking:
- Store images in cloud storage (S3 or similar)
- Use JWT tokens for authentication
- Need database for users, posts, comments, likes
- API should be RESTful

====================================
QUESTIONS
====================================

- Should we support multiple images per post?
- Should comments support images too?
- Do we need user profiles?
- Should there be private/public posts?
- Do we need follow/unfollow features?

For now, keep it simple. These can be Phase 2.
